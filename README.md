# Transmission-Lines--Waveguides-comparision
📘 Introduction

Transmission lines and waveguides are used to carry electromagnetic energy from one point to another.

Transmission lines work well for low and moderate microwave frequencies.

Waveguides are used for high-frequency and high-power microwave applications.

📐 Important Equations

1. Characteristic Impedance (Transmission Line)

Z₀ = √((R + jωL) / (G + jωC))

2. Wavelength in Waveguide

λg = λ / √(1 − (λ / λc)²)

3. Cutoff Frequency (Rectangular Waveguide)

fc = c / (2a)

Numerical problem:

A rectangular waveguide has a broad dimension a = 2.5 cm.
Find the cutoff frequency for the TE₁₀ mode.

Given:
a = 2.5 cm = 0.025 m
c = 3 ×10⁸ m/s

Formula:
fc = c / (2a)

Substitute:
fc = (3 × 10⁸) / (2 × 0.025)
fc = 6 × 10⁹ Hz

Answer: Cutoff frequency = 6 GHz

📝 Conclusion

Transmission lines are used for low and moderate frequencies with TEM mode, while waveguides are essential for high-frequency microwave transmission because they support TE/TM modes with low loss and high power-handling capability.
